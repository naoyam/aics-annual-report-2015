@Comment{
Each entry requires a single keyword in the "keywords" field.

Available keywords: journal, proceedings, invited, poster, deliverable

The keywords indicates a category of an bib item. The "keywords" field in a bib item can have a single keyword, or category, from the above five options. Do not set multiple keywords. The list of publications, talks, deliverables, and posters are grouped into the above five categories. Items with no matching keyword will not be displayed.

Note that the type of each bib item such as "inproceedings" does not affect the grouping. Use "misc" when uncertain.
