\section{Research Activities}

We develop high performance, highly productive software stacks that aim to simplify development of highly optimized, fault-tolerant computational science applications on current and future supercomputers, notably the K computer. Our current focus of work includes large-scale data processing, heterogeneous computing, and fault tolerance. A major ongoing project in our group will deliver a MapReduce runtime that is highly optimized for the intra- and inter-node architectures of the K computer as well as its peta-scale hierarchical storage systems. Another major project focuses on performance and productivity in large-scale heterogeneous systems. We also study high performance graph analytics on the K computer. Below is a brief summary of each project.
